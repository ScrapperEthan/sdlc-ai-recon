# HASE AI-SDLC Assistant — Project State

Living status doc: **where we are across the full SDLC lifecycle**, updated as we go.
Pairs with `BACKLOG.md` (what to build next) and `docs/specs/*.md` (build-ready specs).

## Where we are — SDLC lifecycle

| Stage | Status | Reached | What we have | Next |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Requirements analysis** | 🟡 beachhead | 2026-07-03 | Plain-language ask → structured `ChangeRequest` → **retrieval-grounded target** (repo + controller) with a citation-backed rationale; refuses to guess when ambiguous. Verified on the real mirror (`change.from_intent`). Parser is rule-based (swappable for an LLM) | Real LLM parser; free-form intent; widen beyond the add-endpoint template |
| **Architecture design / impact** | 🟢 foundation | 2026-07-01 | Cross-repo Q&A + impact / dependency / message-routing analysis over the mirror — the retrieval "moat" | Turn understanding into a design proposal for a specific change |
| **Code generation** | 🟡 beachhead | 2026-07-03 | Scaffolding (new service) **+ in-context change to an existing service, now driven by intent+retrieval:** `from_intent` locates the target and `add_endpoint` applies a templated change, verified green on `mc-hk-hase-ingress-api`. Change *content* is still templated (add-endpoint) | Widen change kinds (message listener / DAO / config — REPOMAP already indexes these) beyond the endpoint template |
| **Run tests** | 🟢 thin slice | 2026-07-03 | **Proven end-to-end on a real service:** the tool runs `mvn test` on the generated change in `scratch/` and emits `BUILD_RESULT.md` (PASS, exit 0) itself — verified on `mc-hk-hase-ingress-api` (real Maven 3.9.6, Zulu JDK 21) | Broaden beyond a single templated GET endpoint (message listener / DAO / config), and drive the change from a real ask not a hardcoded template |
| **Build** | 🟢 thin slice | 2026-07-03 | Same run: real service compiles + tests green in `scratch/`; `change/build.py` resolves `mvn`→`mvn.cmd` on Windows and records launch failures instead of crashing | Same broadening; later `mvn package` / multi-module |
| **Deploy** | 🔵 TBD | — | — | Stays human-gated. Possibly an **MCP server / skills** so the internal copilot / opencode **assists** a human through deploy (never autonomous) — see "Deploy" below |

## The moat (cross-cutting, underneath every stage)

The durable asset is the **retrieval/context layer** over the ~390-repo estate
(`retriever/`, the dependency graph, the message map, the DB snapshot, CodeGraph).
Every stage above is only as good as what the assistant can understand about the
system — so this is where we keep investing. Model + UI are swappable; the moat is not.

## Roadmap mapping (our 3 steps ↔ the lifecycle)

- **Step 1 — cross-repo Q&A** → powers *Requirements-understanding* + *Architecture design*. 🟢
- **Step 2 — new-module scaffolding** → *Code generation*, first slice (skeleton). 🟡
- **Step 3 — batch maintenance at scale** → *Code generation + Test + Build* across many repos (CVE / upgrades). ⚪

---

## Target architecture & future task flow

**How the assistant works (mechanism).** The model does not memorize the code — it's a
tool-using loop: a question triggers retrieval tools (`search_code`/`impact`/`trace`/
`call_graph`…) that read pre-built indexes (code mirror, dependency graph, message map,
CodeGraph), and it answers with `repo/path:line` citations. The indexes + tools are the
durable asset (the moat); the model is swappable.

**Scaling 15 → 390 repos — keep two things separate:**
- **Indexing is FORCED to partition.** CodeGraph can't hold 390 repos in one graph
  (~150 MB / 15 repos), so split the estate into per-domain bundles (public/shared, SMS,
  PN, WhatsApp…), each with its own index — `group.py` bundles + `index/REPOMAP.md` so the
  agent can "narrow first". **Invest here; this is the moat and the key 15→390 step.**
- **Agent topology is a CHOICE.** Start with **ONE agent + a narrow-first router** (pick
  the relevant domain(s), then query only those bundles). **Not** a multi-agent orchestra:
  orchestration (routing, stitching answers, latency, cost, debugging) is fragile, and
  HASE is event-driven / cross-domain by nature (flows span domains) — so a "domain" must
  be a **storage partition, not a wall**. Multi-agent (orchestrator + domain specialists)
  is a valid *later* evolution when a domain gets huge or you want parallelism/isolation —
  it's the swappable brain, so defer it.

**Future task pipeline (one task, end-to-end):**

`read code → write spec.md → design → generate code → compile+test → diff → human review`

Status: read 🟢 (retrieval) · **locate/target 🟡 (intent → retrieval-grounded repo+controller
with cited rationale, refuses to guess — verified on the real mirror 2026-07-03)** · generate 🟡
(`scaffold/` new modules + `change/` edits, now intent-driven) · diff 🟢 · compile+test 🟢
(proven end-to-end 2026-07-03: generate → `mvn test` PASS → diff, `mirror/` untouched) ·
**full write-spec / design for non-templated changes ⚪ — the remaining front-end gap.** "Read"
comes first because the spec must be grounded in real code; serve it via the narrow-first
router (a domain sub-agent only later, if needed).

## Current focus / recommended next: a thin **vertical slice** of the loop

Rather than pushing right toward deploy, the highest-value next move is to close a
thin end-to-end slice for **one real task** (e.g. "add an endpoint / message listener
to an existing service"):

1. **Understand impact** — we have this (Step 1 retrieval). 🟢
2. **Generate a real code change** — extend scaffolding from "skeleton" to actual code
   in the context of an existing service. 🟡→
3. **Compile + test it green** in `scratch/` (`mvn`) — pulls in *Run tests* + *Build*. ⚪→
4. **Produce a diff for human review.**

This single slice is the most credible capability to demonstrate: *the assistant writes
a change that compiles and passes tests, grounded in our own code, without touching prod.*

## Cross-cutting / platform track (parallel to the capability line)

Productionize the assistant itself so a team can actually use it. Currently single-box,
`127.0.0.1`, no auth. Needs: SSO/auth, multi-user, audit logging, index freshness /
re-index. ⚪ — see `BACKLOG.md` #7 (freshness) and #9 (deployment & security).

## Deploy — parked intentionally

In a regulated bank, deploy is heavily governed and **stays human-driven**. We are NOT
targeting autonomous deploy. Option under consideration for later: expose build/deploy
helpers as an **MCP server or skills** so the internal copilot / opencode can **assist**
a human through deploy steps (pre-flight checklists, config diffs, release notes) — the
human still reviews and clicks. Revisit once the vertical slice (generate → test → build)
is solid.

## Milestone log (append-only; add a dated line when a stage's status changes)

- **2026-07-01** — Step 1 cross-repo Q&A **live end-to-end** on internal GPT-5.5:
  retrieval tools (`impact`/`consumers`/`producers`/`trace`/`search_code`/`read_file`/
  `call_graph`/`unified_impact`/`citations`), real streaming, citation pills, usage,
  JSON sessions. Pilot = 15-repo ingress→messaging→tracking flow.
- **2026-07-02** — Step 2 scaffolding pilot (spec-driven, delivered via Codex):
  - **P1** — generated `pom.xml` inherits the real `mc-hk-hase-api-parent` + `mc-hk-hase-api-starter`, coordinates derived from the mirror (`docs/specs/scaffolding.md`). Verified on real mirror.
  - **P2** — single thin `*-api` repo made structurally faithful to a real HASE repo: package auto-derived (`com.hsbc.hase.digital.api.<name>`), SHP/sonar platform files, full source layout, starter-only; `*-core` split & `--type job` deferred (`docs/specs/scaffolding-phase2.md`). Verified on real mirror.
  - **Vertical slice — Phase 1 started** (`docs/specs/vertical-slice.md`, `change/`): tool copies an existing service to `scratch/`, adds a GET endpoint in the house style, generates a test, and emits `CHANGE_DIFF.md`. Build is mock-injectable + a `--skip-build` flag; **real `mvn` compile/test deferred — the box has no Java/Maven toolchain yet (Step 0 probe failed; being requested from IT).** 5 tests pass. This begins the *Run tests / Build* stages once the toolchain lands.
  - **P2.1** — copied platform/API files sanitized: inherited governance/account/branch/URL/email values blanked to `<REVIEW>` and listed in `REVIEW_DIFF.md` (`docs/specs/scaffolding-p2-sanitize.md`). `api.meta` (a per-service JSON descriptor) uses aggressive blanking — every string value blanked except the identity keys `assetName`/`contractFileName` (rewritten to the new name); config flags/structure kept. **Verified on the real mirror: no real account/org/business/branch/URL values remain. → Step 2 scaffolding pilot COMPLETE.**
- **2026-07-03** — **Vertical slice Step 0 PASSED on the internal box** (toolchain landed: Zulu JDK 21 + Maven 3.9.6). An *unmodified* `mc-hk-hase-ingress-api` copied to `scratch/probe/` compiled and tested green (`COMPILE_EXIT=0`, `TEST_EXIT=0`) — building a HASE service outside its repo is feasible. First real `change.add_endpoint` run generated a correct change (`@GetMapping("/status")` inserted into `IngressResource.java`, `mvn.cmd -q test` passed when run manually, `mirror/` untouched — 3659 files hash-identical) but the tool crashed with `[WinError 2]` before emitting the review artifacts. Root cause + fix: on Windows Maven is `mvn.cmd`; `change/build.py` now resolves `mvn`→`mvn.cmd` via `shutil.which` and records a launch failure as a build failure instead of crashing (so `CHANGE_DIFF.md`/`BUILD_RESULT.md` are always emitted). 8 unit tests pass.
- **2026-07-03 (Phase 2 VERIFIED on real mirror)** — `change.from_intent` (intent → retrieval-grounded target → templated change → verify → diff) ran green end-to-end on the real box via RUNBOOK 4: unit tests 19 OK; `index/REPOMAP.md` regenerated; `--explain-only` resolved *"add a /status endpoint to the ingress service"* → `mc-hk-hase-ingress-api` + `IngressResource.java` with a cited rationale; full run → `mvn.CMD -q test` **PASS (exit 0)**, `CHANGE_DIFF.md` clean (2 files), `mirror/` untouched (`MIRROR_HASH_UNCHANGED=True`, 3659 files); a valid-path-but-vague ask (*"add a /status endpoint to the api"*) → **REFUSED**, non-zero, candidates listed, no guess. Note: a no-path ask is stopped earlier by the parser, not the resolver — two distinct refusal paths (RUNBOOK 4 Step 4 fixed to reflect this). **The NL-intent → locate front-end is now a working, verified beachhead. Next: widen change kinds (message listener / DAO / config) and/or a real LLM parser.**
- **2026-07-03 (later)** — **Vertical slice CLOSED end-to-end.** After the box pulled the fix, `python -m change.add_endpoint mc-hk-hase-ingress-api --path /status --out-dir scratch` ran to completion: the tool itself emitted `CHANGE_DIFF.md` (2 files — `IngressResource.java` +4 lines, new `IngressResourceStatusTest.java`) and `BUILD_RESULT.md` (**`mvn.CMD -q test` → PASS, exit 0**); `mirror/` untouched (`MIRROR_HASH_UNCHANGED=True`, 3659 files). The **read → generate real change → compile+test → reviewable diff** loop now works on a real HASE service, prod untouched. Cosmetic caveat: an existing test prints a stack trace into the output tail (exit code still 0). **This is the thin-slice proof; next is widening the change kinds and driving the change from a real ask (NL intent + retrieval) rather than a hardcoded `--path` template — the pipeline front-end.**
- **2026-07-07 — A sibling team's AI-SDLC skill-hub found; scaling + skill-reuse plan set.** Another HASE team already runs a full requirements→design→code→review→SIT-test workflow as GitHub Copilot **Agents + Skills** (3 agents, 14 skills; `agents/*.md` + `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; **no MCP**). Internal Codex evaluated their real clone (RUNBOOK 5 → local `PEER-SKILL-HUB-EVAL-REPORT.md`): most front-end/review skills are **portable pure-prompt markdown** (`prd-writing`, `tdd-writing`, `api-sit-case-*`, `api-test-result-reviewer`); runtime-bound ones (`jira-data-search`, `rag-data-search`, `pib-api-test-executor`) hardcode internal endpoints; coding skills (`domain-papi-*`) are PIB-specific. **They work single-repo → no cross-repo blast-radius, which is exactly our moat's fill.** Decisions (user): (1) **scale our index 15→~390 repos first** (CodeGraph + retrieval, domain-partitioned); (2) **fork their portable front-end skills into a separate repo** and adapt ourselves — **do not depend on their team** (they provide only the repo as-is); (3) dev teams run skills in **GitHub Copilot Agent mode**, so integrate our moat as a **`cross-repo-impact` skill that curls a centrally-hosted retrieval endpoint** (mirroring their `rag-data-search`), invoked by the Plan/Review agents; (4) also hand dev teams our existing cross-repo **Q&A app**. Analysis: `docs/PEER-TEAM-ANALYSIS-zh.md`, `docs/PEER-MEETING-PREP-zh.md`.
